# Homework - Covid-19 Classification using CNNs
Homework of Computer Vision Course

AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis (MIA) Workshop is devoted to medical image analysis, with emphasis on radiological quantitative image analysis for diagnosis of diseases. The focus is on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine and Deep Learning (ML, DL) approaches that target effective and adaptive diagnosis; there is also a particular interest in approaches that enforce trustworthiness and automatically generate explanations, or justifications of the decision making process.
COV19D Competition is based on a database of chest CT scan series that is manually annotated with respect to Covid-19/non-Covid-19 diagnosis.

The aim of this Computer Vision project is to build a classifier using some models CNNs on PyTorch to classify ct scans of covid and non-covid patients.

# DICOM to JPG
DICOM files have been converted to JPG (basically using this [repo](https://github.com/abubakr-shafique/Dicom_to_Image-Python). You can run the example code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LGHNDqndfTRWp4-YAuKsWG7XWdqL1N6Z?usp=sharing)
